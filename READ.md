This repository contains my first assigment that I had to create from scratch

##  My Portfolio

Created a simple portfoloio with most of all the the work I have done. Three of the projects showen are just place holders as I am still learning new skills daily to imoprove and eventually add onto my collection.

### Building My Portfolio

I am still not the very best at css, however I leanred alot about css and as I progressed I got more comfortable with messing around and changing without fear of competely ruining my website. Images tend to be a little bit duanting as I cannot seem to get they them to size properly to the website. Especialy when it comes to using pixels to measure where it can fit.
